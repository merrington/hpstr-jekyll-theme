The New Year always relates to being the time to start things off fresh - from making resolutions, to starting new projects, etc. So to follow along with this "tradition" I've decided to launch my own blog/portfolio/website.  
<!--break-->

The main motivating factor behind this is to have somewhere to share things I've done - most likely around software development, but not necessarily exclusive to that - outside of the usual spaces (e.g. - social media). In doing so I hope to create a sort of résumé/CV/portfolio/something as well as using this to provide the encouragement I need to start working on additional projects outside of what I do at work, and sharing it with others.

[My Github](https://github.com/merrington/) repos are currently in a very sad, neglected state. The last couple months I've (very) slowly been adding some small projects I worked on in my free time. My first goal over the next little while is to clean that up - some no longer relevant forks of repos will just be deleted, and some of the projects just need to be spruced up a tad to look a bit more "presentable".  

With that being said, here's to a new year!
