Mike is a technology and software enthusiast. After completing a Software Engineering degree at [Western University](http://www.uwo.ca/) (at the time it was more-appropriately named "The University of Western Ontario"), Mike went to work for [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) where he is still employed. During his time at IBM Mike has worked in multiple roles - often customer-facing - and in technical areas relating to software support and development.

Outside of work, Mike is an avid music-lover, hockey fan (unfortunately rooting for the Maple Leafs) and recently got in to motorcycles.

He's also keen to getting dirty and working with hands, everything from building Lego to tearing down and building a deck from scratch...
