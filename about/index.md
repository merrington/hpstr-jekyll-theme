Mike is a technology and software enthusiast. After completing a Software Engineering degree at [Western University](http://www.uwo.ca/) (at the time it was more-appropriately named "The University of Western Ontario"), Mike went to work for [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) where he is still employed. During his time at IBM Mike has worked in multiple roles - often customer-facing - and in technical areas relating to software support and development.

Outside of work, Mike is an avid music-lover, hockey fan (unfortunately rooting for the Maple Leafs) and recently got in to motorcycles.
